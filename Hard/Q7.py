#Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
def construct_dict(students, subjects):
    dict = {}
    for i in range(len(students)):
        dict[students[i]] = subjects[i]
    return dict

students =  ["Sam", "Alice", "Mona"]
subjects = ["Commerce", "Science", "Computer"]
print(construct_dict(students, subjects))
